==============

Steps for setting up my baseline VPS server for Node.js

This is broken into 3 parts:

- *server.js* - install Git, Node, NPM and commonly used packages
- *profile.sh* - install dotfiles, edit bash profile
- *sites.sh* - set up sites folder, repos, and web serving helpers

I wrote this up after the fact, so it may not be 100% yet. But should be useful for reference!
